TO DO

High Priority:

- Rounds/turns system.
  - Way to Queue up actions - i.e: pathfinding for movement.
  - AI(pathfinding, strategy, attacking, spawning)
- UI design(InventoryPane, ActionPane, InfoPane)
- Entity Actions(heal, attack, move)
- 

Low Priority:

- Audio system.
- Sprite management.
- Replace Swing's Timer with our own timer.
